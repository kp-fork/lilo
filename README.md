Here are a few things Lilo can do:

- Send Lilo photos of food, and it tracks your calories.
- Leave a voice note on your run to pause your supplements, and Lilo adds a TODO.
- Ask Lilo to remind you when the Knicks game starts and send you score updates every 5 minutes.
- Ask Lilo to read an article out loud. Or give you a summary of the top stories on Hacker News.
- Collect a Uber receipt, and pull it up later to file for a reimbursement at work.
- Schedule a meeting with Jess next week, ask for suggestions on meeting location, and next week, remind you when it’s time to leave for the meeting.

Telegram is the easiest way to use Lilo, but it also works wherever you do: WhatsApp, web, desktop, mobile, or email. There's a companion mobile and desktop app for when you want to work more visually, like move things around on your TODO list.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 10+
- An API key for at least one of: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abi/lilo.git
cd lilo
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env.local` at the repo root:

```bash
# Required
LILO_WORKSPACE_DIR=./workspace          # where the agent's files live
LILO_SESSIONS_DIR=./.lilo-sessions      # persistent chat session storage

# At least one chat model
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                   # enables GPT 5.5
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...            # enables Claude Opus 4.7
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...            # enables OpenRouter-routed models

# Recommended
LILO_AUTH_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password   # locks down the whole app
```

See [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) for the full list.

### 3. Run

```bash
pnpm run dev   # backend (http://localhost:8787) + frontend (http://localhost:5800) + typechecks
```

Open `http://localhost:5800`. If you set `LILO_AUTH_PASSWORD`, you'll get a
login screen on first visit.

Your workspace should be auto-bootstrapped from the bundled
[workspace-template/](./workspace-template), so you'll immediately have a
Desktop, TODO list, Calories tracker, and a handful of other apps to play with.

## Telegram setup

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-...
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=long-random-secret
LILO_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789
```

Point your Telegram bot webhook at `https://your-lilo/api/inbound-telegram`
and pass the same secret as Telegram's `secret_token`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://your-lilo/api/inbound-telegram" \
  -d "secret_token=$TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

`LILO_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` must contain numeric Telegram user IDs, not
group chat IDs. To find yours, message your bot and inspect `getUpdates`, or use
a Telegram ID helper bot such as `@userinfobot`.

> Each contact gets their own persistent chat, so the agent remembers your
> conversation across messages.

For email, WhatsApp, and native app link setup, see
[External messaging](./docs/external-messaging.md).

## Security

Lilo is built for a **single, self-hosted user** — not multi-tenant SaaS.

- **Set `LILO_AUTH_PASSWORD`** before exposing an instance to the internet.
  It gates the web app, all REST/SSE/WebSocket endpoints, and workspace
  apps. Without it, everything is open.
- **The agent has shell, filesystem, and network access.** Prompt injection
  is a real risk — anything it reads (web pages, emails, PDFs) can try to
  hijack it. Keep messaging allowlists (`LILO_EMAIL_ALLOWED_SENDERS`,
  `LILO_WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_SENDERS`, `LILO_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`) tight, and
  keep credentials in env vars, not the workspace.
- **Webhooks** (`/api/inbound-*`) skip the password gate on purpose and use
  provider-signed verification instead.
- **Report security issues privately** through GitHub Security Advisories.
  Please don't open public issues for sensitive reports.
